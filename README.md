TAGALOG SYLLABLE-BASED LIP-READING: A VISUAL SPEECH RECOGNITION UTILIZING LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY  
Members:  Regine Balaoro Janreck Cayabyab Ma. Socorro Corpuz Shaina Mirandilla  â€Œ  

In this research, we propose a lipreading computing system capable of recognizing common Tagalog syllables words by performing word extraction from the mouth movements. Its goal is to transform the input speech feature vector sequence into a sequence of words during the speech.

The suggested model's purpose is to develop a visual speech recognition system that recognizes Tagalog words based on syllables. Furthermore, visual speech recognition (VSR) aims to recognize the content of speech based on lip movements, without relying on the audio stream. The study concepts, methodology, and implementation will help a variety of entities which include Hearing-Impaired People, Speech Impaired People, Medical Professionals, Community, Security and Future Researchers.
